## Definitions
### `g-index` :
<em>`g-index`</em> is used to measure skill-acquisition efficiency of any intelligence system on a set of real-world tasks.<br>
Mathematically, It's calculated as:<br>

### `Intelligent System (IS)` : 
The `Intelligent System (IS)` generates a `Skill Program (P)` when input the specification for a given task `T'`. The formulation here is method-agnostic, and allows the g-index benchmark to extend to any new techniques in the future.
### `Task (T')`: 
A natural language prompt that forms an instruction to the machine what to do.
### `Skill Program (P')`: 
A DAG Program generated by an `IS` to perform task `T'`
### `Divergence Metric (Δ)`:
Difference between two program DAGs. If Δ = 0, programs are the same.
### `Curricula (C)`: 
Data that the `IS` uses to train itself is denoted by `C` or Curricula.
### `Domain`:
A set of tasks C can be clustered into `Task Domains`. 
Tasks within the same domain are <i>closer</i> to each other than tasks in different domains.
### `Domain Distance Score (Ω)` : 
Domain Distance of a Task `T'` from a set of tasks `C` is the 
similarity between optimal DAG program for `T'` and it's nearest neighbour in `C`.
### `Performance (θ)` :
1 - `Δ` for a given task `T'`
### `Generalization Difficulty (GD)` : 
`exp(10 * Ω)` between task `T'` and curriculum `C`.
### `Priors (ρ)` : 
Information which is built into the `IS` _before_ training. This is negligible (~0) for our current set of experiments.
### `Experience (E)` : 
Compute ( in `FLOPS` or `MIPS` ) used to train the `IS` on the curricula `C`
