## Definitions
### `g-index` :
A measure of intelligence defined as average of `TC` across all `tasks_scope`, : `avg_across_TC(θ * Σ (P(C_n) * ( (GD(T_i,C_n)/(P + E(C_n)) ))))`
### `Intelligent System (IS)` : 
The intelligent system (IS) generates a `Skill Program (S)` to do `Task (T)`
### `Task (T)`: 
A natural language prompt that forms an instruction to the machine what to do.
### `Skill Program (S)`: 
A program or DAG generated by an `IS` to perform task `T`
### `Curricula (C)`: 
Data that the `IS` uses to train itself is denoted by `C` or Curricula, in our case all data in the train_array
### `Curriculum Item (C_n)` : `C_n` 
Indicates a subset of the curriculum that is specific to a certain Template/Domain
### `Domain (D)` : 
A related set of Tasks/Curricula. currently each template in our system can be it's own domain, but later we can group similar ones together into similar domains. 
### `Divergence Score (DS)` : 
Distance between skill program created by a narrow rule-based generator, and a general-purpose `IS`
### `Performance Theta (θ)` : 
Performance of the `IS` on a task (`1 - DS`)
### `Domain Distance Score (DS)` : 
Fractional divergence/distance between any two given templates/domains/skill programs. `DS` can be used here too, if they are the same.
### `Generalization Difficulty (GD)` : 
`DS` between task domain & curricula domain (or training task and given test flow)
### `P(C_n)` : 
Probability of finding curricula of domain type `C_n` in curricula. or (`samples_of_template_C_n`/`total_number_C_samples`)
### `Priors (P)` : 
Information which is built into the system _before_ training (are you fine-tuning something already fine-tuned?). This is negligible (~0) for most of current models.
### `Experience (E)` : 
Exposure of the `IS` to `Curricula` (tentative : compute * curricula?)
### `Task Contribution (TC)` : 
Contribution of performance on one `task (T)` to the overall `g_index`  this is equal to, for any domain `C_n` in total n domains in curricula `C`  = `θ * Σ (P(C_n) * ( (GD(T,C_n)/(P + E(C_n)) )))`
### `Tasks Scope` or `Task Domains`: 
All the Tasks/Domains in the test array
